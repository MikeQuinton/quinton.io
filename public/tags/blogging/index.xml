      <title>Why I Chose Hugo (And Ditched Jekyll)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When creating a blog, you’ve got a ton of options. Some are just not as simple as Hugo. Hugo has its downsides, sure—but for me, the pros easily outweigh the cons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tried Jekyll at first. The problem? Ruby dependencies. It got annoying fast. I didn’t feel like debugging stuff before I even got to the hard part: actually writing. Weird thing to say as someone in tech, maybe&amp;hellip; but I’d rather save the troubleshooting for when it’s really needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Starting Again</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/IMG_2931-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dummy Image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For me, I&amp;rsquo;m the type of person who says I&amp;rsquo;m starting something and means it&amp;hellip; but actually seeing it through? That part tends to fall off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started a blog in the past, posted maybe once or twice, and that was that. Nothing really came of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been inspired again. A friend of mine, Chris, has been consistently posting content—mostly about Kubernetes and tech stuff he finds interesting. He even runs a YouTube channel. That&amp;rsquo;s probably not something I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing, but seeing his consistency sparked something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
