      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the 31st, I moved to Berlin, which was the reason for the blog outageâ€”or silence, shall we say. But I&amp;rsquo;m now back on track and ready to post some new content related to my new job and my time in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, as of now, I&amp;rsquo;m four days into the new job and settling in pretty comfortably. The new office environment is super welcoming. It&amp;rsquo;s almost like one of those offices you see on TV where people go around high-fiving each other after a successful day. On my second day, the company hosted a self-run auction, which went really well. Afterward, they brought out snacks, beers, and champagne which, of course, was very welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
