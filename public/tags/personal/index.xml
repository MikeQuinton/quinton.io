      <title>Berlin Move, New Job, and First Impressions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the 31st, I moved to Berlin, which was the reason for the blog outage—or silence, shall we say. But I&amp;rsquo;m now back on track and ready to post some new content related to my new job and my time in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, as of now, I&amp;rsquo;m four days into the new job and settling in pretty comfortably. The new office environment is super welcoming. It&amp;rsquo;s almost like one of those offices you see on TV where people go around high-fiving each other after a successful day. On my second day, the company hosted a self-run auction, which went really well. Afterward, they brought out snacks, beers, and champagne which, of course, was very welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Starting Again</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/IMG_2931-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dummy Image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For me, I&amp;rsquo;m the type of person who says I&amp;rsquo;m starting something and means it&amp;hellip; but actually seeing it through? That part tends to fall off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started a blog in the past, posted maybe once or twice, and that was that. Nothing really came of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been inspired again. A friend of mine, Chris, has been consistently posting content—mostly about Kubernetes and tech stuff he finds interesting. He even runs a YouTube channel. That&amp;rsquo;s probably not something I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing, but seeing his consistency sparked something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
