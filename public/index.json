      "content_text": "\u003cp\u003eWhen creating a blog, you’ve got a ton of options. Some are just not as simple as Hugo. Hugo has its downsides, sure—but for me, the pros easily outweigh the cons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried Jekyll at first. The problem? Ruby dependencies. It got annoying fast. I didn’t feel like debugging stuff before I even got to the hard part: actually writing. Weird thing to say as someone in tech, maybe\u0026hellip; but I’d rather save the troubleshooting for when it’s really needed.\u003c/p\u003e",

That part tends to fall off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started a blog in the past, posted maybe once or twice, and that was that. Nothing really came of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut recently, I\u0026rsquo;ve been inspired again. A friend of mine, Chris, has been consistently posting content—mostly about Kubernetes and tech stuff he finds interesting. He even runs a YouTube channel. That\u0026rsquo;s probably not something I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing, but seeing his consistency sparked something.\u003c/p\u003e",
