That part tends to fall off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started a blog in the past, posted maybe once or twice, and that was that. Nothing really came of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut recently, I\u0026rsquo;ve been inspired again. A friend of mine, Chris, has been consistently posting contentâ€”mostly about Kubernetes and tech stuff he finds interesting. He even runs a YouTube channel. That\u0026rsquo;s probably not something I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing, but seeing his consistency sparked something.\u003c/p\u003e",

Most of the \u0026ldquo;brethren\u0026rdquo; think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.\u003c/p\u003e",
