        <div class="content"><p>On the 31st, I moved to Berlin, which was the reason for the blog outage—or silence, shall we say. But I&rsquo;m now back on track and ready to post some new content related to my new job and my time in Berlin.</p>
<p>So, as of now, I&rsquo;m four days into the new job and settling in pretty comfortably. The new office environment is super welcoming. It&rsquo;s almost like one of those offices you see on TV where people go around high-fiving each other after a successful day. On my second day, the company hosted a self-run auction, which went really well. Afterward, they brought out snacks, beers, and champagne which, of course, was very welcomed.</p>
<p>Berlin itself has been a delight. It really is what people say it is—a mix of the everyday businessman to the everyday anti-fascist LGBT activist. Not sure if there&rsquo;s a single term like &ldquo;businessman&rdquo; for that group, but you get what I mean. It&rsquo;s a very diverse place, lots of cultural food, and definitely has that big city energy, which I love. It also seems like there&rsquo;s either a demonstration or a random crazy person out every day—something the locals have definitely warned me about with a laugh.</p>
<p>That being said, every city has its quirks, but Berlin is already starting to feel like home.</p>
<p>More updates soon.</p>
