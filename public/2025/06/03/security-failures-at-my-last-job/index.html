        <div class="content"><p>I recently changed jobs and moved to Berlin—which is another story in itself.</p>
<p>While getting everything set up for my new role, I noticed something. Several days after leaving my last job, I still had access to internal systems: Teams, VPN, project documentation, etc.</p>
<p>Which of course meant I still had access to a lot I definitely shouldn’t have.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="some-things-that-still-haunt-me">Some Things That Still Haunt Me</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>No security cameras.</strong> Not even in places you&rsquo;d expect, like entrances or the server room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The server room was unlocked.</strong> It hosted sensitive data. The room had no lock, poor air conditioning, minimal lighting—and apparently, no fire alarm. Some engineers needed clearance to access certain client systems. I didn’t have it, but I still could’ve walked in and grabbed anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sensitive conversations.</strong> I sat near the IT security office and overheard almost everything—especially discussions about high-risk client projects. Not exactly secure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Passwords never expired.</strong> People were still using credentials they set over a decade ago. No one was ever asked to change them. And yes, after seeing a few exposed by that classic security threat—the average user—you can imagine what some of them looked like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shared admin accounts.</strong> Sticky notes. No MFA. No logs. Just trust, assumptions, and chaos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Audit theatre.</strong> They’d temporarily change configurations to pass compliance checks like Cyber Essentials. There was even a Windows Server 2003 box still in production&hellip; quietly shut down before audits, and powered back on after.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>This wasn’t some scrappy startup. It was a long-running company in a compliance-heavy space.</p>
<p>The problem wasn’t malicious intent—it was a culture of neglect. Compliance was performative. IT lacked authority. HR was out of sync. Leadership assumed everything was “probably fine.”</p>
<p>I didn’t leave because of this stuff. But I wasn’t surprised by any of it.</p>
<p>If you’re in a place like this: protect yourself. Keep notes. And when you leave, check that you’re actually out—because someone might forget to log you off.</p>
