        <div class="content"><p>Today I was thinking about interviews and the potential red flags to look out for. It&rsquo;s something I’ve come to care about a lot more, especially after working at a few companies where I probably should’ve walked away before even starting.</p>
<p>Here’s a list, in no particular order, of things I’ve noticed over the years:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timesheets</strong> – If they’re still doing manual timesheets, you’re probably in for micromanagement.</li>
<li><strong>Outdated systems</strong> – Like printing out forms or filling things by hand. Not a great sign.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;We’re like a family&rdquo;</strong> – Usually means cliques, favoritism, and zero boundaries.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Everyone helps each other out&rdquo;</strong> – Translation: no clear responsibilities, lots of dumping.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;This person fills in because we don’t have that role&rdquo;</strong> – Sounds like understaffing.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Fast-paced, tight deadlines&rdquo;</strong> – Often just means burnout.</li>
<li><strong>MSPs (Managed Service Providers)</strong> – Can be a red flag depending on their structure.</li>
<li><strong>On-call expectations</strong> – Especially if it’s vague or seems constant.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;We’re partners in everything&rdquo;</strong> – Buzzword soup. Often meaningless.</li>
<li><strong>No technical assessment</strong> – Worrying if it’s a technical role.</li>
<li><strong>They look at your CV during the interview</strong> – Means they’re unprepared.</li>
<li><strong>Contradictory answers between rounds</strong> – Test for consistency by asking the same question twice.</li>
<li><strong>Low-energy or visibly unhappy interviewers</strong> – People usually reflect the culture.</li>
<li><strong>Aggressive or condescending interviewers</strong> – Speaks for itself.</li>
<li><strong>No help during technical questions</strong> – The good ones support you through it.</li>
<li><strong>Super long interviews</strong> – Time management matters too.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personal-standouts">Personal standouts</h3>
<p>These ones were the most frustrating in my experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No tech depth in interviews</strong> – I’ve had interviews where no one asked a single real technical question. That lack of depth carried through into the job itself.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;We’re like a family&rdquo;</strong> – I’ve seen this firsthand. Lifers, inner circles, constant brown-nosing. Toxic environment all around.</li>
<li><strong>Vague answers on career growth</strong> – If they can’t describe how people grow in the company, that’s a problem.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Jump right in&rdquo; onboarding</strong> – AKA, no onboarding.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Hit the ground running&rdquo;</strong> – Usually means zero documentation.</li>
<li><strong>C-levels with no tech background</strong> – All sales or finance folks, no one who understands the actual work.</li>
<li><strong>Calling engineers “resources” or “bodies”</strong> – They don’t see you as a person.</li>
<li><strong>Evasive on why the role is open</strong> – You’re probably replacing burnout or turnover.</li>
<li><strong>Work-life balance jokes</strong> – That’s not a flex.</li>
<li><strong>Overexcited that you’re overqualified</strong> – You&rsquo;re likely walking into years of tech debt.</li>
<li><strong>No training or learning budget</strong> – Stagnation ahead.</li>
<li><strong>Wrong people interviewing you</strong> – A PM trying to quiz you on dev stuff? Red flag.</li>
<li><strong>Too busy to train you</strong> – You’ll be flying blind.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding salary talk</strong> – They want your number first so they can lowball.</li>
<li><strong>Shabby office or outdated gear</strong> – Not a great signal about priorities.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Wearing many hats&rdquo;</strong> – Means chaos if they can’t define your actual job.</li>
<li><strong>No clear definition of success</strong> – That’s a setup for failure.</li>
<li><strong>Terrible reviews online</strong> – If they’re consistent, believe them.</li>
<li><strong>Being talked down to</strong> – If they don’t respect you now, they won’t later.</li>
<li><strong>Only one person allowed to speak</strong> – That’s a control issue.</li>
<li><strong>No team structure clarity</strong> – Flat structure can mean no ownership.</li>
<li><strong>Inappropriate personal questions</strong> – Gender or cultural biases sometimes slip in here.</li>
<li><strong>“Work hard, play harder” culture</strong> – Usually code for burnout.</li>
<li><strong>No clear traits of success</strong> – “Just work hard” isn’t a strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Ghosting after interview</strong> – Just rude. And unprofessional.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>I’ve had two jobs where there were no technical assessments. Both times, the interviews were vague: “So you worked with Linux?” I’d say yes, give an example, and they’d move on. No depth. No challenge. And surprise surprise—those jobs were not great.</p>
<p>It’s not about being perfect or demanding. It’s just about being cautious. Some of these red flags on their own might not mean much. But when a few show up together, it’s usually a pattern. Pay attention.</p>
<p>If nothing else, I hope this list helps someone pause and think before jumping into a role that’s waving a few too many red flags.</p>
