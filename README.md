This is my personal blog, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Iâ€™m using the [Serial Programmer theme](https://github.com/sharadcodes/hugo-theme-serial-programmer) by [sharadcodes](https://github.com/sharadcodes) â€” itâ€™s clean, simple, and fits what I was looking for.  
You can check out the themeâ€™s [live demo here](https://sharadcodes.github.io/hugo-theme-serial-programmer/).

That's about it. Just a place to write and tinker.
