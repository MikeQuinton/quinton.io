# Who Am I

Hi, I’m Mike Quinton — a Solutions Engineer navigating the space between order and entropy. I like to share my journey through infrastructure configs, automation mishaps, and the occasional deep dive into debugging rabbit holes.

Whether it’s scripting my way through the Matrix or documenting lessons learned from the field, I’m driven by curiosity and caffeine.

## What I Do

- 🛠️ **Infrastructure & Automation**  
  I specialize in designing and maintaining resilient systems — from on-prem to the cloud (mostly AWS). I enjoy building repeatable, observable workflows with tools like Terraform, Ansible, and CI/CD pipelines.

- 🧠 **Knowledge Sharing**  
  This blog is my digital brain-dump — configs, chaos, and clarity. If you find a post that helps you avoid a facepalm, then it’s doing its job.

- 💬 **Communication**  
  I believe engineers should write and talk well. Complex ideas deserve clear language, and I try to embody that here.
