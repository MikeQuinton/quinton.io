# Who Am I

Hi, I’m Mike Quinton — a Solutions Engineer working in Berlin. I like to share my journey through infrastructure configs, automation mishaps, and the occasional deep dive into debugging.

I’m driven by curiosity and the willingness to learn.

## What I Do

- 🛠️ **Infrastructure & Automation**  
  I specialize in designing and maintaining resilient systems — from on-prem to the cloud. I enjoy building repeatable, observable workflows with tools like Terraform, Ansible, and CI/CD pipelines.

- 🧠 **Knowledge Sharing**  
  This blog is my digital brain-dump to share thoughts about tech and life — just a mix of chaos and clarity. Hopefully you find something helpful here.

- 💬 **Communication**  
  I believe engineers should write and talk well. Complex ideas deserve clear language, and I try to embody that here.

## Elsewhere
