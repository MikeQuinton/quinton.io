I recently changed jobs and moved to Berlin—which is another story in itself.

While getting everything set up for my new role, I noticed something. Several days after leaving my last job, I still had access to internal systems: Teams, VPN, project documentation, etc.

Which of course meant I still had access to a lot I definitely shouldn’t have.

### Some Things That Still Haunt Me

- **No security cameras.** Not even in places you'd expect, like entrances or the server room.

- **The server room was unlocked.** It hosted sensitive data. The room had no lock, poor air conditioning, minimal lighting—and apparently, no fire alarm. Some engineers needed clearance to access certain client systems. I didn’t have it, but I still could’ve walked in and grabbed anything.

- **Sensitive conversations.** I sat near the IT security office and overheard almost everything—especially discussions about high-risk client projects. Not exactly secure.

- **Passwords never expired.** People were still using credentials they set over a decade ago. No one was ever asked to change them. And yes, after seeing a few exposed by that classic security threat—the average user—you can imagine what some of them looked like.

- **Shared admin accounts.** Sticky notes. No MFA. No logs. Just trust, assumptions, and chaos.

- **Audit theatre.** They’d temporarily change configurations to pass compliance checks like Cyber Essentials. There was even a Windows Server 2003 box still in production... quietly shut down before audits, and powered back on after.

This wasn’t some scrappy startup. It was a long-running company in a compliance-heavy space.

The problem wasn’t malicious intent—it was a culture of neglect. Compliance was performative. IT lacked authority. HR was out of sync. Leadership assumed everything was “probably fine.”

I didn’t leave because of this stuff. But I wasn’t surprised by any of it.

If you’re in a place like this: protect yourself. Keep notes. And when you leave, check that you’re actually out—because someone might forget to log you off.
