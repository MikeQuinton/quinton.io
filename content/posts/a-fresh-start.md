For me, I'm the type of person who says I'm starting something and means it... but actually seeing it through? That part tends to fall off.

I started a blog in the past, posted maybe once or twice, and that was that. Nothing really came of it.

But recently, I've been inspired again. A friend of mine, Chris, has been consistently posting content—mostly about Kubernetes and tech stuff he finds interesting. He even runs a YouTube channel. That's probably not something I'll be doing, but seeing his consistency sparked something.

So here I am, giving this another go. Baby steps, right?

The goal for this blog—or at least the place I want it to get to—is somewhere I can share tech-related stuff, post some photos, and just document things that catch my interest.

Let's see where it goes.
