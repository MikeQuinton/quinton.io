On the 31st, I moved to Berlin, which was the reason for the blog outage—or silence, shall we say. But I'm now back on track and ready to post some new content related to my new job and my time in Berlin.

So, as of now, I'm four days into the new job and settling in pretty comfortably. The new office environment is super welcoming. It's almost like one of those offices you see on TV where people go around high-fiving each other after a successful day. On my second day, the company hosted a self-run auction, which went really well. Afterward, they brought out snacks, beers, and champagne which, of course, was very welcomed.

Berlin itself has been a delight. It really is what people say it is—a mix of the everyday businessman to the everyday anti-fascist LGBT activist. Not sure if there's a single term like "businessman" for that group, but you get what I mean. It's a very diverse place, lots of cultural food, and definitely has that big city energy, which I love. It also seems like there's either a demonstration or a random crazy person out every day—something the locals have definitely warned me about with a laugh.

That being said, every city has its quirks, but Berlin is already starting to feel like home.

More updates soon.
