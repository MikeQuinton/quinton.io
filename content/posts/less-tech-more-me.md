So my first few posts have been about... well, me. My thoughts, opinions, that kind of thing. Not really much tech. Maybe the Hugo setup post counts, but even that wasn’t super technical — more of a quick overview and what I thought of it.

I think a lot. Who doesn't? Sometimes it just hits randomly, or when I’m lying there at night sorting through whatever’s on my mind.

It’s been kind of nice though. Writing like this pulls me out of the usual rhythm of work. And as much as I enjoy the computer side of things, it feels good to just let my thoughts out once in a while.

Not sure how long this stretch will last or where it’s going exactly, but for now, this feels right. I guess we’ll see.
