For me, I'm the type of person that would say I'm starting something and will but to see it through and continue doing that is an unlikely.

I started a blog in the past but hardly posted any content. Nothing fruitful came from it.

More recently I've seen some content posted from a friend called Chris which inspired this to happen again for me. He is regularly posting content in relation to Kubernetes and anything else he finds interesting, he even has a youtube channel. Something I probably won't do but for now, I'll start with a blog. Baby steps as they say.

The dream for this or shall we say to place I want it to be is somewhere I can showcase some tech related content, photos, etc...
