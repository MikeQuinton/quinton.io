Today I was thinking about interviews and the potential red flags to look out for. It's something I’ve come to care about a lot more, especially after working at a few companies where I probably should’ve walked away before even starting.

Here’s a list, in no particular order, of things I’ve noticed over the years:

- **Timesheets** – If they’re still doing manual timesheets, you’re probably in for micromanagement.
- **Outdated systems** – Like printing out forms or filling things by hand. Not a great sign.
- **"We’re like a family"** – Usually means cliques, favoritism, and zero boundaries.
- **"Everyone helps each other out"** – Translation: no clear responsibilities, lots of dumping.
- **"This person fills in because we don’t have that role"** – Sounds like understaffing.
- **"Fast-paced, tight deadlines"** – Often just means burnout.
- **MSPs (Managed Service Providers)** – Can be a red flag depending on their structure.
- **On-call expectations** – Especially if it’s vague or seems constant.
- **"We’re partners in everything"** – Buzzword soup. Often meaningless.
- **No technical assessment** – Worrying if it’s a technical role.
- **They look at your CV during the interview** – Means they’re unprepared.
- **Contradictory answers between rounds** – Test for consistency by asking the same question twice.
- **Low-energy or visibly unhappy interviewers** – People usually reflect the culture.
- **Aggressive or condescending interviewers** – Speaks for itself.
- **No help during technical questions** – The good ones support you through it.
- **Super long interviews** – Time management matters too.

### Personal standouts

These ones were the most frustrating in my experience:

- **No tech depth in interviews** – I’ve had interviews where no one asked a single real technical question. That lack of depth carried through into the job itself.
- **"We’re like a family"** – I’ve seen this firsthand. Lifers, inner circles, constant brown-nosing. Toxic environment all around.
- **Vague answers on career growth** – If they can’t describe how people grow in the company, that’s a problem.
- **"Jump right in" onboarding** – AKA, no onboarding.
- **"Hit the ground running"** – Usually means zero documentation.
- **C-levels with no tech background** – All sales or finance folks, no one who understands the actual work.
- **Calling engineers “resources” or “bodies”** – They don’t see you as a person.
- **Evasive on why the role is open** – You’re probably replacing burnout or turnover.
- **Work-life balance jokes** – That’s not a flex.
- **Overexcited that you’re overqualified** – You're likely walking into years of tech debt.
- **No training or learning budget** – Stagnation ahead.
- **Wrong people interviewing you** – A PM trying to quiz you on dev stuff? Red flag.
- **Too busy to train you** – You’ll be flying blind.
- **Avoiding salary talk** – They want your number first so they can lowball.
- **Shabby office or outdated gear** – Not a great signal about priorities.
- **"Wearing many hats"** – Means chaos if they can’t define your actual job.
- **No clear definition of success** – That’s a setup for failure.
- **Terrible reviews online** – If they’re consistent, believe them.
- **Being talked down to** – If they don’t respect you now, they won’t later.
- **Only one person allowed to speak** – That’s a control issue.
- **No team structure clarity** – Flat structure can mean no ownership.
- **Inappropriate personal questions** – Gender or cultural biases sometimes slip in here.
- **“Work hard, play harder” culture** – Usually code for burnout.
- **No clear traits of success** – “Just work hard” isn’t a strategy.
- **Ghosting after interview** – Just rude. And unprofessional.

### Final thoughts

I’ve had two jobs where there were no technical assessments. Both times, the interviews were vague: “So you worked with Linux?” I’d say yes, give an example, and they’d move on. No depth. No challenge. And surprise surprise—those jobs were not great.

It’s not about being perfect or demanding. It’s just about being cautious. Some of these red flags on their own might not mean much. But when a few show up together, it’s usually a pattern. Pay attention.

If nothing else, I hope this list helps someone pause and think before jumping into a role that’s waving a few too many red flags.
